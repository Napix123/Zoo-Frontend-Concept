# Zoo-Frontend-Concept

Project from a 2nd year subject Human-Computer Interaction, where the theme was to make a frontend design for a zoo website using Bootstrap and SCSS. I used JQuery as a part of the project too for making a survey that saves cookies and on the click of the button, shows the average grade for each question. If the grade is between 1 and 2.5, the color turns red, between 2.5 and 3.5 turns yellow and otherwise turns green. Bootstrap was used to make the design for every page on the website, especially using the card class for a lot of things.
